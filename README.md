# Baldur's Gate 3 Artificer
Lone man's effort to rebalance the OG Artificer Mod

## Completed List
Nothing Working

## Intended Changes from Original Mod
I believe some functions of the original mod are slightly strong or missing functions. Hoping to balance them out here before going public? Never made a mod before so wish me luck.

- Repeating Shot: Change damage type back to piercing so that it's not essentially the same as Lvl 5 Agonizing Blast but at Lvl 2.
  - If possible I'll also change it to unlock bonus action attack with buffed weapon instead of consuming bonus action to attack twice. (Admittedly this is to allow The Joltshooter to get it's stacks on the 2nd hit. If it's     still too strong I'll undo it or make it do half damage?)
 
- Artillerist Eldritch Cannon: Make you choose which Cannon you want instead of just getting all 3 for 1 cast.
  - Make tiny handheld cannon no longer a firearm, also have the same function in main or offhand instead of limiting options
 
- Guns: Add +2 amd +3 base guns, as well as unique renaissance firearms from TT: Thunderbuss, Lucent Destroyer, Topaz Annihilator
  - Maybe allow you to combine the pistol and musket with Infernal Iron or SmokePowder to make some Hand Cannon versions of those weapons that deal AOE damage?
  - At least maybe a Sniper Rifle that has longbow range for 2d6 damage
 
-
